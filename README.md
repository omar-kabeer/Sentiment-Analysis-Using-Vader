# Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Vader
## Task
The task of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on artists' pre-release and post-release album posts, with the challenge being accurately determining the sentiment expressed by users.

## Description
In order to solve this problem, we have developed a Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Vader project. This project utilizes the Vader sentiment analysis tool to analyze the sentiment of users' posts related to artists' albums. The following methods are employed to gain insights into user sentiment:

- Analysis of frequent words using wordcloud: By analyzing the most frequently used words in the posts, we can gain an understanding of the overall sentiment expressed by users.
- Analysis of hashtags: Examining the hashtags used in the posts can provide insights into the themes or topics discussed by users and their associated sentiment.
- Analysis of frequent words: Identifying the most commonly used words in the posts can help us understand the predominant sentiment expressed by users.
